        I'm a self-taught Frontend Developer ðŸ¤“ <br />
        I'm head over heels with web-development, and for year and a half that I
        have been studying, this feeling has only grown. My main sources of
        knowledge are Jonas Schmedtmann's HTML & CSS and JavaScript courses,
        Colt Steele's React course, freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design
        curriculum and the Rolling Scopes School JavaScript/Front-end course.
        ...And hundreds and hundreds of hours of Youtube videos & reading Stack
        Overflow ðŸ˜… <br /> I enjoy the process of learning new stuff, especially
        the moment of doing something that was difficult and unclear before.{" "}
        <br />
        Besides programming, I like music and going to the gym.
